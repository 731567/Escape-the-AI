My game is called Escape the AI. The user will be trapped in a house controlled by AI where they will have to go through rooms solving each of the puzzles to be able to move on to the next room. There will be a timer and the player will have to try escaping the house before it runs out. In the first room, the player will need to use their code-breaking skills to figure out what the code is by reading a passage or text. In the second room, the player will need to connect the puzzle to the corresponding piece to unlock the room. The third room will be a Simon Says inspired room where the player will have to follow the colours on the screen to see what the pattern is and repeat the pattern. The last room is an image deciphering room where the player will have to break the code of the images to escape the house. I chose this project because I really enjoy going to escape rooms myself and like to try and escape the room and solve all the puzzles. I believe it will be a fun and interactive game for the player. The project aims to test the person's puzzle-solving and code-breaking skills while making it fun for them as well. I want them to be left wanting to play again and beat their score or try to solve the puzzles again if they werenâ€™t able to.
